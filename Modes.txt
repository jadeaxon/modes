- make a shortcut that opens a cheat sheet showing all shortcuts
    - give it tabs for Windows, Firefox, and Eclipse (and each AHK mode)

- storing your passwords in plaintext in your scripts isn't the best idea
    - use at least a simple encryption

- upgrade 't' so that it detects if to do list is already open in Notepad++ and just goes there 

- create a text pasting mode
    - it has like 26 slots on an always on top window
	- each slot has a string and a triggering letter
	- when you press the trigger letter, the text is pasted
	- this is good if you have a finite set of values your assigning to a bunch of spreadsheet entries
	- you can save preset lists

AHK MODES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

typing mode (data entry)
mouse and keyboard mode (one key commands)
two key verb+noun mode (pure keyboard navigation)
mouse keys mode


A sort of ultra-terse overlay shell for a windowed environment.
Every command is comprised of two letters:
    <verb letter> <object letter>

You perform and action on/using an object or group of objects.

There is a default subject, like $_ in Perl.

So,
c => close active window (or tab if multitabbed)
cw => close window (whether multiple tabs or not)
ct => close tab
ca => close everything
cc => close Concise (suspend)

ob => open (default browser)
oe => open file explorer
os => open selected URL or file
on => open notepad
oc => open command prompt

ma => minimize all
nw => activate next window
pw => previous window



fg => lookup selection using google
fd => lookup selection using dictionary
fw => lookup selection using wikipedia
fc => find file on computer

lc => lock computer

hc => help on the 'close' verb
hcw => what does 'cw' do?
hh => help on help

?g => ask google about selected text
?d => ask dictionary
?w => ask wikipedia
?a => ask wolfram alpha


The problem with two key commands is that it requires you to take your hand off the mouse.  Same problem with using
shift, ctrl, alt, window.
So, there is a way to switch to "one key mode".  All commands are now one key and assume $_ always.
c => close selected
g => google selected
w => wikipedia selected
h => help





There should be a "browsing/surfing mode" that you can do all these things with one hand, one keystroke:
- it assumes you are not inputting any information: just reading and browsing
- right click and select "open link in new window"
    - each keystroke emits a certain kind of click
- close current window (or tab if multiple tabs)
- look up the definition of this word in Wikipedia and a dictionary
- pronounce whatever I've selected (if more than one word, read it out loud via bot)
- copy whatever I've selected
- minimize all
- surf mode off
- side by side tile this window with the last selected
- next window; previous window
- launch default browser
- launch default file explorer
[- launch command prompt and go into text entry mode]
- increment URL and fetch; decrement URL and fetch (if it ends in a number)
- close all windows
- lock computer
- an operation can be prompt guarded
- it would be cool if it had an uberpane fading graphic that said like "x => close all windows" when you emit a command
- one key might be the prefix for two key presses; they always start with that key
